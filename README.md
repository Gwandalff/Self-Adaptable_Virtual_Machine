# Self-Adaptable Virtual Machines

This project aim to create a new implementation pattern for interpreters.
The main objective is to define an architectural solution to resolve the problem of dynamic adaptation in language interpreters.
To do that, we plan to use a modular approach defining an interface in the language specification and multiple modules of dynamic adaptation.
